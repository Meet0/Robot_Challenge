Robot Challenge

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.There are no other obstructions on the table surface.The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

The user can enter the commands interactively using the console or can provide a path to file containing the commands.

Furthermore, user can enter `RESTART` command to re-select the choice of user input and `EXIT` command to exit the application.
